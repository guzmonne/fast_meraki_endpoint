# (Fast?) Meraki Scanning API Endpoint

Similar to [Meraki Endpoint](https://github.com/guzmonne/meraki_endpoint) but using [`fasthttp`](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp).

Not sure if there are any real advantage between the two.

You should check [this](https://github.com/guzmonne/meraki_endpoint) project for more information.
